# flight-delay-analysis

Overview:
This project aims to analyse flight delay data in conjunction with historical weather data and other relevant factors to understand the multi-faceted nature of flight delays. 
By conducting a comprehensive analysis, we hope to identify key factors that contribute to delays, including weather conditions, airline-specific patterns and the impact of routes (country of origin and destination). 
Through this approach, we hope to provide a nuanced understanding of the various factors influencing flight delays and develop insights for airlines and passengers to improve travel planning and minimise disruptions.

Key Questions:
Which airports have the highest rate of flight delays? What factors contribute most to delays at these airports?
How do weather conditions at the airport (precipitation, wind, visibility etc.) impact flight delay rates?
Can you identify specific flights that are chronically delayed? What patterns exist?
How far in advance can you reliably predict if a flight will be delayed based on historical data?
Is there any direct correlation between airport destination and airport origin?
Would there be a possible correlation between distance and minutes delayed?

Airport Analysis:

Day of the week analysis:
In the first graph, we’ve broken down arrival delays by the day of the week. 
Mondays tend to peak in the delay frequency with Tuesday following relatively closely behind as things peter out throughout the week with Sunday seeing an uptick in frequency. 
For the departure delays, we see a similar trend. 

Time of the week analysis:
The first graph examines arrival delays categorized by time of day. 
Nighttime flights experience minimal delays, while the morning and afternoon see a higher frequency of delays. 
The evening timeframe is somewhat similar to mornings and afternoons but with a lower delay rate.

Airline Analysis:

Historical Weather API Analysis:

Conclusion:
In conclusion, we’d like to reiterate that our findings were the result of an exploratory analysis and further research is recommended.

We believe we’ve laid the foundation for more focused investigation and would like point out some key areas to explore further.
More refined data collection
Operational adjustments
Collaboration among airlines and airport
Continuous monitoring

Thank you
